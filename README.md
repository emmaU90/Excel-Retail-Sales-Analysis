# Problem Statement

- What is the key main point?

A US retail company wants to analyze sales data to generate insights for their growth. The  company wants to know the most profitable region and the product categories that  generate the most profit.
The aim of this project is to build an interactive microsoft excel dashboard to allow the users to quickly identify trends in the coffee sales as well as perform exploratory data analysis on the available datasets to generate actionable insights and recommendations.

- What is the ideal solution?

To create a dashboard that provides insights into: 

- What region generates the most sales, profit, and tax?
- What categories generate the most sales per region?
- What is the sales performance per quarter for the 3 years? 

This will help the company to make informed decisions on how to maximum its sales.

# User story

As a data analyst in the company, i have been tasked with working on this project. I have identified the data i need, asked the right questions, and collected the dataset.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions that can generate insights.

# Data source

- What data is needed to achieve this objective?

We need data on the product orders, customers and ship mode which includes their

- order country
- time period
- region
- customers, order and product ID
- sales, profit & tax etc.

# Stages

- Examine both product, order and customer datasets for inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, correctly identify categorical and numerical data.
- Define metrics such as total sales, time trend, profit, sales and tax etc.
- Explore the data, create charts and graphs to visualise trends and insights for recommendations.

# Data cleaning

- What do we expect the clean data to look like?
- What should it contain?
- What limitations should we apply to it?

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis.

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:
- Only relevant columns should be retained.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.

# Discovery

- What did we learn?

We discovered that
1. United State is the highest order sales by country, followed by Ireland, with United Kingdom being the last top sales by country.
2. Don Flintiff, Nealson Cuttler, Terri Farra, Brenn Dundredge and Allis are the top customers by sales.
3. 2021 was the year with the highest sales with a sum of **$13,766**, 2020 sales was **$12,118**, 2019 sales was a total of **$12,187**, and lastly 2022 which was the lowest sales with a sum of **$7,063**.

 # Recommendations

- What do you recommend based on the insights gathered?

1. United State is the highest top sales by country, therefore i recommend we take more orders from United State compared to other countries. 
2. With regards to the top customers by sales, it may be worth considering collaborating or give out special offers, as the potential of return on investments is significantly high in the longrun.
3. Regarding the coffee types, the findings suggest that since Libirical and Arabica had the highest sales over the years, with Arabica reaching $841 in 2021 and Libirical achieving a total of about $844 in 2022, we recommend that the coffee shop produce more of these to maximize sales. Additionally, considering the fluctuation in sales from 2019 to 2022, we suggest analyzing the year with the highest sales and identifying the factors that contributed to that success to apply them in future years.


# Conclusion

Base on the findings and analysis of the coffee sale dashcoard, we can conclude that the project showcases the effectiveness of exploratory data analysis in providing useful insights in dataset that involved the customers, products and the orders.
